## How to

Start serving the website on port 8080 with:
```
npm start
```


## Dev

By defaults, sources are not auto generated. I used `watchify` and `babelify` to do so.
Enable auto building of the `bundle.js` file with:

```
npm run watch
```


## Attain Perfection

- [x] Use `npm` to load `react` and `material-design-lite`
- [x] ~~Auto generate `js` from `jsx`~~ `npm run watch`
- [ ] Autorefresh browser
- [ ] Use existing mdl react library ?
- [ ] Whole website available offline
